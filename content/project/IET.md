We proposes a multi-modal intelligence teaching system, which uses students real-time data in the classes as research samples, including video and audio. Through comprehensive analysis using the machine learning method, feedback on the student’s listening status in real time can effectively help teachers adapt teaching strategy. The system can strive to achieve personalized teaching content recommendation and counseling for students. By means of machine learning, the instant feedback of this multi-modal smart classroom can provide a good help to students’ academic development.
