Transportation Project of Dian Group launched in the spring of 2019, the goal of which is to meet engineering requirement of the transportation system of Pingxiang city, Jiangxi. 8 different violation detection algorithm based on object detection, instance segmentation and deep learning are designed and implemented in the project. Over a dozen of students envolve in this project, while I served as one of the three leaders and write paper about our solid line driving detection. We also wrote paper about our research and development on solid line driving algorithm, SLDNet.The paper is under review for ICTC 2020, and {{% staticref "files/SLD_paper.pdf"  "newtab" %}}paper script{{% /staticref %}} is available now. 

The current public transportation surveillance platform of the city of Pingxiang underwent its construction and upgrade mostly 6 years ago, when deep learning remains developing and the majority of technologies adopted were machine learning and traditional image process algorithms. Deep learning has transcend original method drastically, reflecting necessity of substitution of the system. Practically, we have deployed our deep learning algorithms for upgrading and rebuilding the obsolete traffic monitoring system of a city and achieved improvement on the accuracy, hence spared police department from heavy manual work.
