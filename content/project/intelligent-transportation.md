Transportation Project of Dian Group launched in the spring of 2019, the goal of which is to meet engineering requirement of the transportation system of Pingxiang city, Jiangxi. Several different problems is to solve in the project.
This technical report conclude progress that we made in some of the engineering problems as well as academic literature that we refers to.

The current public transportation surveillance platform of the city of Pingxiang underwent its construction and upgrade mostly 6 years ago, when deep learning remains developing and the majority of technologies adopted were machine learning and traditional image process algorithms. Deep learning has transcend original method drastically, reflecting necessity of substitution of the system. Practically, we have deployed our deep learning algorithms by upgrading and rebuilding the obsolete traffic monitoring system of a city and achieved improvement on the accuracy by 1000%, hence spared police department from heavy manual work.
