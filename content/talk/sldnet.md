Solid line driving is known as one of the major driving violations in China. In this paper, we propose a branched, spatio-temporal convolution neural network, named SLDNet, to recognize these violation acts from photographs captured by surveillance cameras and train it on Pingxiang solid-linedriving dataset. SLDNet can achieve 0.92 in accuracy and 0.91 in recall, which both out-perform the current human review. Our method will be implemented in intelligent transportation systems in Pingxiang city, Jiangxi Province in near future.
